# h0tcorne
My firmware for my corne build with the RP2040 chip. Using [this kit]() from Aliexpress. The name h0tcorne was create only because it is a hotswap kit of the [crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).

## How I made the firmware
The firware is made using QMK. I decided to make my own files after I found it hard to edit files so I could make it work with my RP2040s. 

### Installig QMK firmware
I started by following the [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_getting_started) on how to install their program.

### making new keyboard in QMK
After that I followed a video from [Joe Scotto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjml-K-pV4E) on how to setup my own keyboard files. I know I could read the documentation, but video's work better for me.

## Steps followed
<ol>
    <li>Open QMK firmware/QMK MSYS</li>
    <li>Cd into qmk_firmware folder</li>
    <li>Type: qmk new-keyboard</li>
    <li>Give in a name</li>
    <li>Edit Github name (if neccesary)</li>
    <li>Edit more attribution (if neccesary)</li>
    <li>Give in what layout to use (the number of the choice)</li>
    <li>What chip is powering your keyboard (the number of the choice)</li>
    <li>Now you can start editing the files in that folder that just has been created.</li>
</ol>
